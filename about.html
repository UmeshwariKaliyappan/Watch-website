            <p id="h1">ABOUT US</p>
            <p id="h2">THE IDEA</p>
            <p id="h3">The idea for The Watch Pages came about because people were often asking us for advice about which watch they should buy. The more this happened — and it happened a lot — the more we realized that searching for a watch online is a minefield of information. Leveraging our 20 years of experience working in the watch industry, we understood the intricacies and nuances that come with selecting the perfect watch.

                The individual brand websites are great, but there are hundreds of watch brands in Switzerland alone, so checking out each page individually would take you weeks, and that’s if you know the names of all the brands.
                
                Recognizing the need for a comprehensive platform, we created a solution. The Watch Pages is not just a website but a pioneering resource where you can effortlessly search for new watches worldwide, compare models, check prices, and discover new brands all in one place.
                
                The Watch Pages is also a treasure trove of information, featuring numerous articles designed to inspire and inform. Whether you’re making your first purchase or adding to an existing collection, our articles provide valuable insights to help you make informed decisions.</p>

        <div class="con-2">
            <p id="h1">THE WATCH FINDER</p>
            <p id="h3">Today, The Watch Pages is the world’s largest watch database and features over 150 watch brands and over 20,000 individual watches (and it is growing every week). If you are a newbie to our industry, searching for a watch is as simple as finding a vacation home on Airbnb – you just choose your preferences in our filters and let our search find you the perfect watch. And if you are a bit of an expert, you can have a lot of fun with our advanced filters and search watch functions and complications to your heart’s content.</p>

            <p id="h3">Susanne Samuelsson and Aaron Pitts started this website in 2019, and it has been quite the journey. We really hope you enjoy exploring and researching the perfect watch for yourself or a loved one. The journey is often as fun as the purchase.</p>
